### 4. **Advanced Object Detection Models**

#### 4.1 Faster R-CNN
- Region Proposal Network (RPN) for generating regions of interest
- ROI pooling for feature extraction

#### 4.2 Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD)
- Predicting multiple bounding boxes and class probabilities in a single pass

#### 4.3 You Only Look Once (YOLO)
- Dividing the image into a grid and predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell
- Variants: YOLOv2, YOLOv3, YOLOv4

#### 4.4 RetinaNet
- Focal loss for handling class imbalance between background and object classes
- Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for multi-scale detection

### 5. **Model Evaluation in Object Detection**

- Measuring the overlap between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes

#### 5.2 Precision and Recall
- Understanding true positives, false positives, and false negatives in the context of object detection

#### 5.3 Mean Average Precision (mAP)
- Averaging precision values over different IoU thresholds and object classes

### 6. **Frameworks and Tools**

#### 6.1 TensorFlow and Keras
- TensorFlow Object Detection API

#### 6.2 PyTorch
