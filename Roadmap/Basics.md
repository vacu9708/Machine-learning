1. Strengthen your basics:

Math: Dive deep into linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics.
Programming: Ensure proficiency in Python, as it's the primary language for AI and ML. Libraries to know: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
2. Fundamental ML Knowledge:

Understand supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
Learn about algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, SVM, clustering, etc.
Grasp the concepts of bias-variance tradeoff, overfitting, regularization, evaluation metrics, etc.
3. Deep Learning Basics:

Neural Networks: Architecture, activation functions, forward/backward propagation.
Optimization: Gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and variations like Adam and RMSprop.
Frameworks: Get hands-on with TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch.
