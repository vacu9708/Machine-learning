My plan : First making deep learning without much understanding, and then studying and understanding how the algorithm works hard after.

* [Handwriting recognition](https://github.com/vacu9708/Machine-learning/tree/main/Handwriting%20recognition)
* [Object detection(YOLO)](https://github.com/vacu9708/Machine-learning/tree/main/Object%20detection)
